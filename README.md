## Research Log Fields 📝

Each log entry can contain:

1. **What I plan to read today?** - Set your reading intentions
2. **What did I read today?** - Track your reading progress
3. **What did I learn today?** - Capture key learnings
4. **What new things did I think of today?** - Record new ideas and insights
5. **What did I code/implement today?** - Document your development work
6. **What did I write today? Or, what did I teach others?** - Track your knowledge sharing
7. **What are some things I should try tomorrow?** - Plan your next steps

## Platform Support 📱💻

This app works on:
- **iOS** - Native mobile app
- **Android** - Native mobile app  
- **Web** - Progressive Web App (PWA)

### Web Deployment 🌐
Your Research Notebook can be deployed as a web app with a built-in **Express proxy server** to avoid CORS issues!

**Quick Start:**
```bash
npm install           # Install dependencies (including Express)
npm run server        # Run proxy server locally (port 3000)
npm run build:web     # Build web app for production
vercel --prod         # Deploy to Vercel
```

**Deploy to Vercel:**
- 🔷 **Vercel** (recommended) - Full Express server deployment

**About the CORS Proxy:**
Since browsers block direct requests to Google Sheets, we've added an Express proxy server that:
- ✅ Handles CORS for web browsers automatically
- ✅ Only used by web (mobile apps connect directly to Google Sheets)
- ✅ Runs as a proper Node.js server on Vercel
- ✅ Includes health check and debugging endpoints

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- A Google Sheet setup with proper API access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd MyResearchNotebook
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
GOOGLE_SHEET_DB_URL=your_google_sheet_api_url_here
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

5. Run on your device:
   - **iOS:** `npm run ios`
   - **Android:** `npm run android`
   - **Web:** `npm run web`
   - **Mobile (Expo Go):** Scan the QR code with Expo Go app

## Google Sheets Setup 📊

Your Google Sheet should have the following columns (headers in the first row):

- `id` - Unique identifier (UUID)
- `created_by` - Author name (hardcoded to "basil")
- `date` - Date of the log (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `plan_to_read` - Reading plans
- `did_read` - What was read
- `learned_today` - Learning notes
- `new_thoughts` - New ideas
- `coded_today` - Coding/implementation notes
- `wrote_or_taught` - Writing or teaching notes
- `try_tomorrow` - Tomorrow's plans
- `created_at` - Timestamp of creation
- `updated_at` - Timestamp of last update

### Setting Up Google Sheets API

You'll need to create a Google Apps Script or use Google Sheets API to handle CRUD operations. The expected endpoints are:

- **GET** `GOOGLE_SHEET_DB_URL` - Fetch all logs
- **POST** `GOOGLE_SHEET_DB_URL` - Create a new log
- **PUT** `GOOGLE_SHEET_DB_URL?id={id}` - Update a log
- **DELETE** `GOOGLE_SHEET_DB_URL?id={id}` - Delete a log

Example Google Apps Script can be deployed as a web app to provide these endpoints.

## 🚀 Deploying to Vercel

Deploy both the **Expo web app** and **Express proxy server** to Vercel in a single project:

### Prerequisites

1. **Vercel Account**: Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. **Google Sheets Setup**: Complete [GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md](./GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md) first
3. **Git Repository**: Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket

### Quick Deployment

#### Option A: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Login to Vercel
vercel login

   - **Build Command:** `npm run build:web`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist`
   - **Install Command:** `npm install`

3. **Add Environment Variables**
   - Click **"Environment Variables"**
   - Add variable:
     - **Name:** `GOOGLE_SHEET_DB_URL`
     - **Value:** Your Google Sheets Web App URL (from Apps Script)
   - Select **all environments** (Production, Preview, Development)

4. **Deploy**
   - Click **"Deploy"**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete
   - Your app will be live!

### What Gets Deployed

Your Vercel deployment includes:

```
your-app.vercel.app/
├── /                    → Expo Web App (React)
├── /health             → Express Health Check
└── /api/proxy          → Express Proxy (handles Google Sheets)
```

**Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** Static Expo web build served from `dist/`
- **Backend:** Express server running as serverless function
- **Routing:** Configured in `vercel.json`
- **CORS:** Handled by Express middleware

### Verify Deployment

1. **Check Health Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/health
   ```
   
   Should return:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "timestamp": "...",
     "environment": "production"
   }
   ```

2. **Test the Web App:**
   - Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app`
   - Try creating a research log
   - Verify data appears in your Google Sheet

### Updating Your Deployment

**Automatic Deployment:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update app"
git push
```
Vercel automatically redeploys on push!

**Manual Deployment:**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Environment Variables Management

**Add a variable:**
```bash
vercel env add VARIABLE_NAME
```

**List variables:**
```bash
vercel env ls
```

**Remove a variable:**
```bash
vercel env rm VARIABLE_NAME
```

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your project in Vercel Dashboard
2. Click **Settings** → **Domains**
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS records as instructed
5. SSL certificate is automatically provisioned

### Troubleshooting Deployment

#### Build Fails

**Check logs:**
```bash
vercel logs <deployment-url>
```

**Common issues:**
- Missing dependencies: Run `npm install` locally first
- TypeScript errors: Fix with `npm run lint`
- Environment variables: Make sure they're set in Vercel

#### App Deployed But Not Working

**Test the proxy:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/health
```

**Check environment variables:**
```bash
vercel env ls
```

**View function logs:**
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
- Click on latest deployment → Functions tab

#### CORS Errors Still Appearing

1. Verify proxy is working: `curl https://your-app.vercel.app/health`
2. Check browser console for the actual API URL being used
3. Verify `GOOGLE_SHEET_DB_URL` is set correctly
4. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

### Mobile Apps (iOS/Android)

Mobile apps connect **directly** to Google Sheets (no proxy needed):
- Build and deploy separately using EAS
- No Vercel deployment required for mobile
- See `eas.json` for build configurations

### Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Google Sheets Web App is set up and deployed
- [ ] `.env` file has `GOOGLE_SHEET_DB_URL` for local testing
- [ ] Tested locally: `npm run server` and `npm run web`
- [ ] Committed all changes to Git
- [ ] Pushed to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket

After deploying:
- [ ] Health endpoint works: `/health`
- [ ] Can view logs in the web app
- [ ] Can create a new log
- [ ] Can edit a log
- [ ] Can delete a log
- [ ] Data persists in Google Sheets

### Monitoring & Logs

**View logs:**
```bash
vercel logs
vercel logs --follow  # Real-time
```

**Check deployment status:**
```bash
vercel ls
```

**View specific deployment:**
```bash
vercel inspect <deployment-url>
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Enable Caching:** Already configured in `vercel.json`
2. **Monitor Usage:** Check Vercel Dashboard → Analytics
3. **Optimize Images:** Use Expo's image optimization
4. **Set up Monitoring:** Add services like Sentry (optional)

### Cost

**Vercel Free Tier includes:**
- ✅ 100 GB bandwidth/month
- ✅ Serverless function executions
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ Global CDN
- ✅ Custom domains

**Typical usage for personal project:** Well within free tier limits
